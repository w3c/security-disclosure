    <p>
      This document defines how to report suspected security vulnerabilities in <em>W3C standards and
        specifications</em> (technical reports), so that issues can be triaged, confirmed, and resolved through the
      appropriate W3C processes.
      <br>It is not for reporting vulnerabilities in software implementations or W3C operational infrastructure (see <a
        href="#out-of-scope">Out of scope</a>).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="sotd">
    <p class='note'>
      This document is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and may be changed at any time and without notice.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recognizes that there may be some security issues in W3C standards and
      specifications. W3C appreciates researchers giving feedback on our work, because it is critical to keeping the Web
      secure. If you have found a security issue in a W3C specification, your help is very important.
    </p>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this policy is to describe how the vulnerability disclosure process works for standards at W3C.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Scope and Application</h2>
    <p>W3C is a standards development organization that publishes Technical Reports, including W3C Recommendations,
      Notes, and Registries, which describe Web technologies and specifications. While these documents may include
      occasional references or example source code, W3C does not build or maintain implementations of their standards.</p>
    <p>Therefore, this policy applies to <strong>design vulnerabilities or security issues described in W3C
        Specifications</strong>.</p>
    <p id="out-of-scope">This policy <strong>does NOT</strong> cover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implementation or configuration vulnerabilities</strong> in products, open-source projects, or
        services that may implement W3C standards. These issues must be addressed by their corresponding vendor or
        maintainers, as W3C does not have a formal means to reach these parties. </li>
      <li><strong>Vulnerabilities in W3C infrastructure and services</strong> that support w3.org domains. These are the
        responsibility of W3C Systems, which has its <a
          href='https://www.openbugbounty.org/bugbounty/w3c_systeam/'>vulnerability disclosure policy</a>.</li>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Process and Policy</h2>
    <p>W3C appreciates the comments made by researchers on their work. The response from W3C will depend on the type of
      technical report in which the problem was found, the severity of the problem, and the complexity of the solution.
      W3C will try to resolve and correct security issues as soon as possible. It follows the process that is based on
      the recommended steps of ISO/IEC 29147 (Vulnerability Disclosure - VD) and ISO/IEC 30111 (Vulnerability Handling -
      VH).</p>
    <p>W3C handles and routes reports according to the type and maturity of the document in which the Security Issue is
      reported. </p>
    <h3>Reporting a Vulnerability in a W3C Standard</h3>
    <p>If you think you have found a vulnerability in a W3C document, please contact <a
        href='mailto:standards-vulnerability@w3.org'><strong>standards-vulnerability@w3.org</strong></a> for coordinated
      disclosure. </p>
    <p>This email serves as the point of reference for assessment and action by the group designated to coordinate
      Vulnerability Disclosure and Handling, composed of the W3C Team and relevant groups.</p>
    <p>It is advisable to send encrypted messages using the PGP key to <a
        href='mailto:standards-vulnerability@w3.org'>standards-vulnerability@w3.org</a>.This. This email does not have a
      public archive.</p>
    <p>To facilitate the process, your <em>advisory</em> should include details such as those recommended by ISO/IEC
      29147 and NIST SP 800-216:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The specific document</strong> in which the vulnerability is present (e.g., its title, stable URL, and
        publication date). </li>
      <li>A concise <strong>description of the type of vulnerability</strong> (e.g., Use of unsafe cryptographic
        algorithms). </li>
      <li><strong>Steps to reproduce</strong> the vulnerability, ideally a benign, non-destructive proof of concept.
      </li>
      <li>The <strong>impact of exploiting this vulnerability</strong> and how it could be used in an attack scenario.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Proposed corrective or mitigating measures</strong>, if any. </li>
      <li>Your contact details (optional, to enable anonymous reporting, but helpful for follow-up clarifications).</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Please note that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No &quot;Bug Bounties&quot;:</strong> W3C does not pay &quot;bug bounties&quot; for reported
        vulnerabilities. </li>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: The <em>Reporter</em> and the Coordinator involved in this policy will
        respect the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks, especially regarding
        intellectual property rights, confidential business information, and public and national security interests.
        Sensitive vulnerability information should be communicated confidentially to minimise risk. </li>
      <li><strong>Researcher Protections</strong>: W3C recognizes the importance of good-faith security research. W3C
        will provide <strong>non-prosecution information security researchers and an exemption from civil
          liability</strong> for their activities, acknowledging the challenges faced by vulnerability researchers. This
        policy is designed to be compatible with common vulnerability responsible disclosure good practice and does not
        permit acting in a manner inconsistent with applicable law.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Receipt and Acknowledgment of the Security Issue (VD)</h3>
    <p>Once received, security issues will be <strong>acknowledged within 3 business days</strong>, establishing the
      communication channel with the reporter.</p>
    <h3>Verification of the Security Issues (VH)</h3>
    <p>After the acknowledgement, the Security Issue will be evaluated to determine its validity, technical criticality,
      importance, and potential impact.</p>
    <p>W3C will aim to <strong>verify the issue’s validity and inform the reporter within 15 working days</strong>. If
      more information is needed to verify the security issue, W3C will request additional details from the source.</p>
    <p>The advisory will be handled according to the type of document to which it refers.</p>
    <h3>Handling and Resolution development (VH)</h3>
    <p>W3C will then collaborate with the <em>reporter</em> and the groups impacted by the security issue, which will
      primarily involve updating the relevant document.</p>
    <h4>W3C Recommendations - Published</h4>
    <p>These are completed, community-reviewed standards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If the <strong>Working Group that produced the Recommendation is still active,</strong> the Working Group is
          <em>accountable</em> for determining the most suitable approach to address it. If confirmed, the vulnerability
          might be addressed via:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An erratum (for minor issues or corrections that do not change the normative content). W3C Working Groups
            <strong>must keep a public record of errors</strong> reported for Recommendations, compiled no less
            frequently than quarterly.
          </li>
          <li>An updated Recommendation specification document (revising the Recommendation). </li>
          <li>An entirely new document to handle the issue. </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the <strong>Working Group is closed</strong>, the W3C Team is <em>accountable</em> for determining the
          most suitable approach to address the issue. The severity of the issue will determine the next steps: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minor issues can be covered with errata (potentially maintained by the W3C Team if no group is chartered).
          </li>
          <li>For more significant updates, the W3C Team may promote a different approach.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>Class 3 or 4 changes, as per W3C Process, can trigger more extensive review and patent policy implications.</p>
    <p>The issue will be handled in the <strong>Security Issue functionality on GitHub</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Candidate Recommendations (CR) and Working Drafts (WD) - In Development</h4>
    <p>These are documents adopted by a W3C Working Group, but that they are not yet finalized.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>W3C Working Groups should formally address any substantive review comments about a technical report promptly.
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>The issue will be handled on the <strong>associated Working Group mailing list or the Security Issue
        functionality on GitHub</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Editor&#39;s Drafts - Early Stage/Individual Contributions</h4>
    <p>These are not officially adopted documents in W3C. Editor&#39;s Drafts, that haven&#39;t been published as a W3C
      specification, have no official standing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The issue should be <strong>handled and discussed with the editors</strong> of the document. </li>
      <li>Although not formally adopted, the issue can also be discussed on the <strong>associated Working Group mailing
          list or the Security Issue functionality on GitHub</strong>.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>The issue will be handled on the <strong>associated Working Group mailing list or the Security Issue
        functionality on GitHub</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Discontinued, Obsolete, or Rescinded Documents</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>W3C Technical Reports that have been marked as discontinued, obsolete, or rescinded are <strong>unlikely to
          have action taken on them</strong> in response to a security issue report. Still, the Team should evaluate
        listing them in the Status of the document (SOTD).</li>

    </ul>
    <p>The issue will be handled in the <strong>Security Issue functionality on GitHub</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Community Group Reports</h4>
    <p>These are not officially adopted documents in W3C, and the <a
        href='https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/#deliverables'>Community and Business Group Process regulates
        them</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any issues found should be <strong>handled and discussed with the editors</strong> of the document. </li>

    </ul>
    <p>The issue will be handled in the <strong>associated Community Group mailing list or the Security Issue
        functionality on GitHub.</strong></p>
    <h4>Member’s Submissions</h4>
    <p>These are not officially adopted documents in W3C. Member Submissions are proposed by Members for consideration.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any issues found should be <strong>handled and discussed with the editors</strong> of the document. </li>

    </ul>
    <p>The issue will be handled <strong>according to the member&#39;s policy</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Release and Dissemination (VD)</h3>
    <p>Once the update has been made available and sufficient time has been allowed to implement updates and releases of
      related technologies, W3C encourages the <strong>sharing and public disclosure of information about fixed
        vulnerabilities</strong>, including a description of the vulnerabilities, information allowing users to identify
      the affected standard, the impacts, their severity, and clear, accessible information to help implementers and
      users remediate. In some cases, where security risks of publication outweigh security benefits, disclosure may be
      delayed until after implementers and users have had the opportunity to apply the relevant countermeasures.</p>
    <p>W3C welcomes requests to disclose your report once the vulnerability has been resolved and aims to coordinate
      public release. If the <em>reporter</em> wishes to be publicly recognized, W3C will acknowledge them for reporting
      the vulnerability, provided the reporter wishes to be publicly credited.</p>

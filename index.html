    This document is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and may be changed at any time and without notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    This March 2017 <a href='http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/'>W3C Team Submission</a>, is a proposal for security and privacy disclosure programs.

   By publishing this document, Philippe Le Hegaret made a formal submission to W3C for discussion. Publication of this document by W3C indicates no endorsement of its content by W3C, nor that W3C has, is, or will be allocating any resources to the issues addressed by it. This document is not the product of a chartered W3C group, but is published as potential input for further work.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many organizations making software and hardware products encourage their
  customers and users to provide feedback about bugs in their products. Especially important are
  bugs related to security which  can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or
  privileges in their products. However, in some cases, customers and security researchers
  are reluctant to provide such information to vendors. This is
  particularly the case when their actions could be interpreted as
  circumventing measures that control access to copyrighted works. There are existing statutes
  prohibiting the circumvention of technological protection measures
  (TPMs), such as section 1201-1203 of the US DMCA, as well as laws in other territories
  (EUCD implementations in the EU; Bill C-11 in Canada; and other laws throughout Asia,
  Latin-America, Australia, NZ, etc).</p>

 <p>The deployment and ubiquity of the Web reinforce the importance of maintaining strong security in the Web Platform.
    We rely on broad participation, testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact.
    As such, we should assure that such broad testing and audit continues to be possible, as it is
    necessary to keep both design and implementation quality high.</p>

<p>This document provides a template that vendors should
  adopt as best practices and would remove impediments to disclosing security and privacy bugs.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class='issue'>
    Not sure if this section is actually helpful. (remove it?)
    </p>
  <p>In 2015, the <a href='https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/'>W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> issued a <a href='https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/'>statement</a>:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/">
  <p>
    The Web has been built through iteration and collaboration, and enjoys strong security because
    so many people are able to continually test and review its designs and implementations. As the
    Web gains interfaces to new device capabilities, we rely even more on broad participation,
    testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact. Therefore, W3C
    policy should assure that such broad testing and audit continues to be possible, as it is
    necessary to keep both design and implementation quality high.
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The Director has determined that one of the ways to address the concerns is to have a set of best practices.
    This document is a proposal from the W3C Team for those best practices and may get further work and refinements at the W3C.
  </p>
  <p>
    This document is intended for:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><dfn>security and privacy researchers</dfn>, interested in participation, testing and auditing of <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/#def-user-agent'>user agent</a> to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact.</li>
    <li><dfn>organizations</dfn>, interested in protecting their users and applications from frauds, malwares, and computer viruses, as well as interested in ensuring proper adherence to security and privacy considerations including in W3C Recommendations.</li>

<h2>W3C Security Disclosure and Privacy Best Practices</h2>
<p>
  This section contains a template of typical coordinated disclosure program best practices that we recommend for adoption by organizations.
</p>
<blockquote style='font-style: italic'>
    <p>We <span style='font-style: normal'>(the organization)</span>:</p>
    <ol>
    <ol>
      <li>Agree not to bring suit against you, recommend law enforcement investigation, or cooperate with law enforcement investigation, if your disclosure meets the criteria listed in this section;</li>
      <li>Request that you give us a reasonable time (usually not to exceed 90 days) before publicly disclosing specific details of the vulnerability;</li>
      <li>Request to be provided an appropriate level of detail on the vulnerability to allow us to identify and reproduce the issue. Detail should include target URLs, request/response pairs, screenshots, and/or other relevant information;</li>
      <li>Agree to confirm, within a reasonable time, receipt of your disclosure (such as 3 days) and the validity of your disclosure (such as
10 days);</li>
      <li>Request that your vulnerability research not create service disruption (e.g. DoS), privacy issues (i.e. accessing a customer’s data), or data destruction, within a reasonable effort.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Your organization may not impose any further conditions or restrictions on the disclosures but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to sending disclosures or interacting with vulnerability researchers such as the following: interest in specific disclosures, compensations, choice of law and dispute resolution. Your organization may also list in-scope, such as data exposure, and out-of-scope disclosures, such as brute forcing approach.

<p>In addition, we also recommend that your organization keep the researcher informed of progress in fixing the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> your organization must provide a reasonnable mean of communications for receiving disclosures and may also provide additional services to ensure encrypted communications.</p>
      
</li>

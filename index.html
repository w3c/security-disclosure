  from frauds, malwares, and computer viruses, as well as interested in ensuring proper adherence to security and privacy considerations included in W3C Recommendations. It also
  assures broad participation, testing, and audit from the security community to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 2015, the <a href='https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/'>W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> issued a <a href='https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/'>statement</a>:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/">
  <p>
    The Web has been built through iteration and collaboration, and enjoys strong security because
    so many people are able to continually test and review its designs and implementations. As the
    Web gains interfaces to new device capabilities, we rely even more on broad participation,
    testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact. Therefore, W3C
    policy should assure that such broad testing and audit continues to be possible, as it is
    necessary to keep both design and implementation quality high.
  </p>

    The Director has determined that the best way to address the concerns is to have a set of best practices.

<h2>W3C Security Disclosure Best Practices</h2>
<p>
  With respect to a Recommendation developed by W3C, the W3C Security Disclosure Guideline compliance
  contains obligations on security researchers as well as organizations.
</p>
<!-- we recommend that orgs use best practice which puts obligation -->

<!-- missing this is our proposed best practices -->


    <p>The organization:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>MUST agree not bring a lawsuit against the security researcher or ask law enforcement to investigate the person if the organization determines that a disclosure meets the criteria for security researcher and are not out of scope;</li>
      <li>MUST be provided a reasonable time (such as 90 days) before public disclosure can be made;</li>
      <li>MUST be provided an appropriate level of detail on the vulnerability to the organization to allow it to identify and reproduce the issue. Detail SHOULD include target URLs, request/response pairs, screenshots, and/or other information;</li>
      <li>MUST confirm, within reasonnable times, the reception of the security disclosure (such as 3 days) and the validity of the disclosure (such as 10 days);</li>
      <li>MUST provide a reasonnable mean of communications for sending disclosures and MAY provide additional services to ensure encrypted communications;</li> 
      <li>SHOULD not encounter service disruption (e.g. DoS), privacy issues (i.e. accessing a customer’s data), and data destruction when performing vulnerability research, within a reasonable effort;</li>
      <li>SHOULD keep the security researcher inform of progress in fixing the issue;</li>
      <li>MAY provide compensation for security vulnerability reports;</li>
      <li>MAY NOT impose any further conditions or restrictions on the disclosures but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to sending disclosures or interacting with security researchers such as the following: interest in specific disclosures, compensations, choice of law and dispute resolution.
    </ol>

  <section>
    <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
    <p>
      The following issues are considered out of scope:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SSL vulnerabilities related to configuration or version</li>
<li>Denial of Service (DoS)</li>
<li>User enumeration</li>
<li>Brute forcing</li>
<li>Secure flag not set on non-sensitive cookies</li>
<li>HTTPOnly flag not set</li>
<li>Logout Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</li>
<li>Issues only present in old browsers/old plugins/end-of-life software browsers</li>
<li>HTTP TRACE method enabled</li>
<li>Vulnerability reports related to the reported version numbers of web servers, services, or frameworks</li>
<li>Clickjacking on pages without authentication and/or sensitive state changes</li>
<li>Vulnerability reports that require a large amount of user cooperation to perform unlikely or unreasonable actions which would be more symptomatic of a social engineering or phishing attack and not an application vulnerability (e.g. disabling browser security features, sending the attacker critical information to complete the attack, guiding the user through a particular flow and requiring them to enter malicious code themselves, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This document describes a set of guidelines for security and privacy disclosures, to assure broad participation, testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact.</p>
</section>

<section id="sotd">
  <p>
    In response to requests to clarify W3C position regarding 
    This document is intended to be published as a W3C Team submission.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 2015, the <a href='https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/'>W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> issued a <a href='https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/'>statement</a>:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/">
  <p>
    The Web has been built through iteration and collaboration, and enjoys strong security because so many people are able to continually test and review its designs and implementations. As the Web gains interfaces to new device capabilities, we rely even more on broad participation, testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact. Therefore, W3C policy should assure that such broad testing and audit continues to be possible, as it is necessary to keep both design and implementation quality high.
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    There has been a series of attempts to issue a broad agreeement applicable to all participants in a
    Working Group regarding regulations of circumbention of technological measures that effectively
    control access to a work protected by copyrigh. The scope however was broad and went beyond
    assuring broad participation, testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model
    intact. This document is intended for
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><dfn>security and privacy researchers</dfn>, interested in participation, testing and auditing of <a>user agent</a> to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact.</li>
    <li>organizations, interested in protecting their users and applications from frauds, malwares, and computer viruses, as well as interested in ensuring proper adherence to security and privacy considerations including in W3C Recommendations.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <p>A <dfn id='user-agent'>user agent</dfn> is any software that retrieves, renders and facilitates end user interaction with web content. This document identifies the following user agent architectures:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>platform-based user agent, native user agent</strong>: User agents that run on
    non-web platforms (operating systems and cross-OS platforms, such as Java) and perform content
    retrieval, rendering and end-user interaction facilitation themselves (e.g. Firefox, Edge,
    Chrome, Opera, Windows Media Player, QuickTime Pro, RealPlayer).</li>
    <li><strong>embedded user agent, plug-in</strong>: User agents that "plug-in" to other user
    agents or applications (e.g. media player plug-in for a web browser, web view component).
    Embedded user agents can establish direct connections with the platform (e.g. communication
    via platform accessibility services).</li>
    <li><strong>web-based user agent</strong>: User agents that have user interfaces that are
    implemented using web content technologies and are accessed by users via a user agent. Web-based
    user agents transform content into web content technologies that the host user agent can render
    (e.g. Web-based ePub reader, Web-based video player).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>W3C Security Disclosure Guidelines</h2>
<p>
  With respect to a Recommendation developed by W3C, the W3C Security Disclosure Guideline compliance
  contains obligations on security researchers as well as organizations.
</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
    <p>
      The following issues are considered out of scope:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SSL vulnerabilities related to configuration or version</li>
<li>Denial of Service (DoS)</li>
<li>User enumeration</li>
<li>Brute forcing</li>
<li>Secure flag not set on non-sensitive cookies</li>
<li>HTTPOnly flag not set</li>
<li>Logout Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</li>
<li>Issues only present in old browsers/old plugins/end-of-life software browsers</li>
<li>HTTP TRACE method enabled</li>
<li>Vulnerability reports related to the reported version numbers of web servers, services, or frameworks</li>
<li>Clickjacking on pages without authentication and/or sensitive state changes</li>
<li>Vulnerability reports that require a large amount of user cooperation to perform unlikely or unreasonable actions which would be more symptomatic of a social engineering or phishing attack and not an application vulnerability (e.g. disabling browser security features, sending the attacker critical information to complete the attack, guiding the user through a particular flow and requiring them to enter malicious code themselves, etc.)</li>
</ul>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>Security researchers</h3>
  <p>The security and privacy researchers:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>MUST agree to a time period of no more 90 days before public disclosure;</li>
  <li>MUST provide appropriate level of detail on the vulnerability to the organization to allow them to identify and reproduce the issue. Detail SHOULD include target URLs, request/response pairs, screenshots, and/or other information;</li>
  <li>SHOULD make a reasonable effort to avoid service disruption (e.g. DoS), privacy issues (i.e. accessing a customer’s data), and data destruction when performing vulnerability research;</li>
  <li>MUST not require compensation for security vulnerability reports.</li>
  </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Organizations</h3>
    <p>The organizations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>MUST agree not bring a lawsuit against the security researcher or ask law enforcement to investigate the person if the organization determines that a disclosure meets the criteria for security researcher and are not out of scope;</li>
      <li>MUST confirm the reception of the security disclosure within 3 days and MUST confirm the validity of the disclosure within 10 days;</li>
      <li>MUST provide an email address for sending disclosures and MAY provide additional services to ensure encrypted communications;</li> 
      <li>MAY NOT impose any further conditions or restrictions on the disclosures but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to sending disclosures or interacting with security researchers such as the following: interest in specific disclosures, compensations, choice of law and dispute resolution;
      <li>MAY keep the security researcher inform of progress in fixing the issue.</li>
    </ol>

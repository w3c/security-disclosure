<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many companies who make software and hardware products encourage their
  customers to provide feedback about bugs in their products. Especially important are
  bugs related to security which  can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or
  privileges in their products. However, in some cases, customers and security researchers
  are reluctant to provide such information to vendors. This is
  particularly the case when their actions could be interpreted as
  circumventing measures that control access to copyrighted works. There are existing statutes
  prohibiting the circumvention of technological protection measures
  (TPMs), such as section 1201-1203 of the US DMCA, as well as laws in other territories
  (EUCD implementations in the EU; Bill C-11 in Canada; and other laws throughout Asia,
  Latinamerica, Australia, NZ, etc).</p>

<p>This document provides a set of best practices that vendors should
  adopt that when communicated to customers and security researchers would
  remove impediments to disclosing these security bugs.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class='issue'>
    Not sure if this section is actually helpful. (remove it?)
    </p>
  <p>In 2015, the <a href='https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/'>W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> issued a <a href='https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/'>statement</a>:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/blog/TAG/2015/11/16/strong-web-platform-statement/">
  <p>
    The Web has been built through iteration and collaboration, and enjoys strong security because
    so many people are able to continually test and review its designs and implementations. As the
    Web gains interfaces to new device capabilities, we rely even more on broad participation,
    testing, and audit to keep users safe and the web’s security model intact. Therefore, W3C
    policy should assure that such broad testing and audit continues to be possible, as it is
    necessary to keep both design and implementation quality high.
  </p>

    The Director has determined that the best way to address the concerns is to have a set of best practices.
    This document is a proposal from the W3C Team for those best practices and may get further work and refinements at the W3C.

<h2>W3C Security Disclosure Best Practices</h2>
<p>
  This section contains a template of typical disclosure best practices that we recommend for adoption by organizations.
</p>
<blockquote style='font-style: italic'>
    <p>We <span style='font-style: normal'>(the organization)</span>:</p>
    <ol>
    <ol>
      <li>Agree not to bring suit against you, recommend law enforcement investigation, or cooperate with law enforcement investigation, if your disclosure meets the criteria listed below;</li>
      <li>Request that you give us a reasonable time (usually not to exceed 90 days) before publicly disclosing specific details of the vulnerability;</li>
      <li>Request to be provided an appropriate level of detail on the vulnerability to allow us to identify and reproduce the issue. Detail should include target URLs, request/response pairs, screenshots, and/or other information;</li>
      <li>Agree to confirm, within a reasonable time, receipt of your security
disclosure (such as 3 days) and the validity of your disclosure (such as
10 days);</li>
      <li>Request that your vulnerability research not create service disruption (e.g. DoS), privacy issues (i.e. accessing a customer’s data), or data destruction, within a reasonable effort;</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Your organization may not impose any further conditions or restrictions on the disclosures but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to sending disclosures or interacting with security researchers such as the following: interest in specific disclosures, compensations, choice of law and dispute resolution. Your organization may also list in-scope, such as data exposure, and out-of-scope disclosures, such as brute forcing approach.

<p>In addition, we also recommend that your organization keeps the security researcher inform of progress in fixing the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> your organization must provide a reasonnable mean of communications for receiving disclosures and may also provide additional services to ensure encrypted communications.</p>
